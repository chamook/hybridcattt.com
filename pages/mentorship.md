I've been working in the tech industry for 10+ years, growing from an apprentice
to a seasoned developer who have held lead positions in multiple companies.

Two years ago I decided to actively give back to the community by mentoring and coaching
iOS developers in my free time. Within the last year, I've mentored four people in my spare time,
and currently, I have three mentees.

I try to focus on underrepresented folks because I believe that diversity is
key to solving the world's problems. Diversity means not only gender or race, but also education and
even country of origin.
I also coach junior developers who have a hard time finding their first full-time job.

I'm not taking new mentees at the moment, but don't hezitate to reach out
and I will do my best to help.

All my mentorship is completely free, no strings attached.
If you would like to support my efforts,
you can do so by buying me a virtual coffee.
