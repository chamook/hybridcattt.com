I've been working in the tech industry for almost 15 years, growing from an apprentice
to a seasoned developer who has held lead positions in multiple companies. I've trained and mentored dozens of developers.

### üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ For startups 

Most early stage founders can‚Äôt afford to hire senior engineers in-house.

We will advise you on technical direction and mentor your promising juniors continuously, with fraction of the cost.

So you can sleep tight knowing that your tech is in safe hands.

Reach out at hello@hybridcattt.com to find out how I can help you with your startup! 

### üë©‚Äçüíª For individuals

Two years ago I decided to actively give back to the community by mentoring and coaching
iOS developers in my free time.

I'm more likely to take you on if you are from a group that's underrepresented in tech.
Diversity means not only gender or race, but also education and even country of origin.

I have 2-3 mentees at any given time. It's a number where I can offer reasonable level of support. 
I'm not taking new mentees at the moment, but don't hesitate to reach out
and I will do my best to help.

Private mentorship is completely free, no strings attached.
If you would like to support my efforts,
you can do so by buying me a virtual coffee.
