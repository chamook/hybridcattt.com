I've been working in the tech industry for almost 15 years, growing from an apprentice
to a seasoned developer who has held lead positions in multiple companies. I've trained and mentored dozens of developers.

### üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ For startups 

Most early stage founders can‚Äôt afford to hire senior engineers in-house.

I will advise you on technical direction and mentor your promising juniors continuously, with fraction of the cost.

So you can sleep tight knowing that your tech is in safe hands.

Reach out at _hello@hybridcattt.com_ to find out how I can help you with your startup üöÄ 

### üåè Career coaching package

You can also book a career coaching package with me. 
I will review your profile and code from the point of view of a hiring company. 

You'll get actionable advice on what to improve in your profile and code to make it more attractive to employers.
I will also give you tips on going through interviews and on searching for jobs abroad.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Free mentorship program

Two years ago I decided to actively give back to the community by mentoring and coaching
iOS developers.

I have 2-3 mentees at any given time. It's a number where I can offer reasonable level of support. 
Private mentorship is completely free, no strings attached.

I'm not taking new mentees at the moment, but don't hesitate to reach out
and I will do my best to help. 
I'm more likely to take you on if you are from a group that's underrepresented in tech.
Diversity means not only gender or race, but also education and even country of origin.
