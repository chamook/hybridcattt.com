Hi there,

My name is Marina, I'm a software developer focusing on development for Apple platforms, living in Copenhagen.
I've been
in tech for over ten years, and nine years with iOS, leading teams and building apps & SDKs.

I'm a Unix geek turned Apple nerd 🤓 I deeply care about privacy, equal opportunity, and climate change 💚

You can find me in the core iOS team at [Say Their Names project ✊🏿](https://saytheirnames.io), co-organizing
[CopenhagenCocoa](https://www.meetup.com/CopenhagenCocoa/) meetups, and [mentoring folks](/mentorship/). I also offer
consulting services.

My latest 9-to-5 adventure was leading the iOS team at [Storytel](https://storytel.com) for 4 years, supporting
company's growth from a small startup to a 500-people company.
I've also worked at [Citrix/GetGo](https://get.gotoassist.com), [PrimeApp](https://vk.com/primeapp) and [iD East](https://id-east.ru). 
My CV and references can be found on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hybridcattt).
