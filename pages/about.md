Hi there,

My name is Marina, I'm a software developer focusing on development for Apple platforms, living in Copenhagen.
I've been in tech for almost 15 years. Working with Apple platforms since 2011, leading teams and building apps & SDKs.

I'm a Unix geek turned Apple nerd 🤓 Topics I care about include privacy, equal opportunity, and climate change 💚

Besides [offering consulting services](/mentorship/) and building indie products (stay tuned!), 
you can find me curating <a href="https://ioscodereview.com"> iOS Code Review newsletter</a>, maintaining [Say Their Names project ✊🏽](https://saytheirnames.io) and co-organizing
[Copenhagen Cocoa](https://www.meetup.com/CopenhagenCocoa/) meetups.

My latest 9-to-5 adventure was leading the iOS team at [Storytel](https://storytel.com) for 4 years, supporting
company's growth from a small startup to a 500-person company.
I've also built B2B products at [Citrix/GetGo](https://get.gotoassist.com), led consumer app development at [PrimeApp](https://vk.com/primeapp) and built apps for over a dozen of companies at Russia's largest agency [iD East](https://id-east.ru). 
My CV and references can be found on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hybridcattt).
