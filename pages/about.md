Hi there, 

My name is Marina, a software engineer focusing on development for Apple platforms, living in Copenhagen 🇩🇰 I've been in tech for over ten years, and nine years with iOS, leading teams and building apps & SDKs.

I'm a Unix geek turned Apple nerd 🤓

You can find me in the core iOS team at [Say Their Names project ✊🏿](saytheirnames.io), co-organizing [CopenhagenCocoa](https://www.meetup.com/CopenhagenCocoa/) meetups, and [mentoring folks](/mentorship/). I also offer consulting services, as well as focus on my own apps. 

My latest 9-to-5 adventure was leading the iOS team at [Storytel](https://storytel.com) for 4 years, supporting company's growth from a small startup to a 500-people company. 
I've also worked at Citrix/GetGo, PrimeApp and iD East.
