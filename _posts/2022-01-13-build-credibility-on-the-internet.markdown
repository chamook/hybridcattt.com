You have credibility online when someone looks at your profile and thinks: 
this person knows their stuff!

Even if you're an expert in your field, if people can't see that from your online profile, they won't reach out.

This guide will help you create a meaningful online presence and get better job opportunities, freelance clients, and a curious audience.

## A bit on why I wrote this

I've been working in tech since 2008, yet until 2019 I didn't have a personal website. 
By then my public GitHub had a few tiny contributions, I had one article on Medium and gave two talks at local meetups.

It wasn't until I started using Twitter in January 2019, that I started getting recognized and even invited to speak at conferences. An online presence made a huge difference! And it eventually played a big role in me going independent and working with some awesome companies.

I've also hired a lot during the last decade, and seen hundreds of resumes of developers of all levels. As someone screening incoming applications, you definitely pay attention to profiles that stand out more than others. I'm also mentoring junior devs, and I regularly get questions about getting the first job. 

I hope this guide helps you as much as these bits helped me 🙌

## 🪞 Step 1: Describe yourself - your TL;DR

Many describe themselves by their job - 'xxx at YYY Co'. That is the easiest way to go, but it doesn't describe YOU.

Instead, try to think of your goals and interests. Make a short bio using words like enthusiast, building, learning, creating.

For example:
- 2D artist learning 3D
- UX enthusiast building iOS apps

Use this TL;DR everywhere where you enter your bio.

## 🗿 Step 2: Create a foundation

Own a domain with your full name or username, or as close to that as possible.

Host the simplest 'business card' website on your domain. You can add a blog, about page, etc later.

List all relevant links to your profiles. For example: LinkedIn, Twitter, Github, Medium, Dribble, etc. 
Don't link to social accounts such as Instagram or Facebook, unless you post there about your work.

To build a simple website, you can use one of the builder services like [carrd.co](https://carrd.co). These services usually charge a fee for custom domains though. The free option is to host a plain index.html on [Netlify](https://carrd.co) - that's what I do. You can also use static site generators like Jekyll - Netlify supports them out of the box.

Here's how my website looked in the beginning:

![First version of hybridcattt.com](/assets/posts/credibility/old_site.png)

It was handwritten HTML hosted on Github Pages. Current version is built on Jekyll and hosted on Netlify. 


## 🖼 Step 3: Have a recognizable visual brand

Use the same avatar everywhere. Ideally, it should have a recognizable palette or be black & white.

Have the image file ready for upload. It'll surprise you how often you'll end up using it! To fit most platforms, the image should be square and looking good when circled.

Use the same, unique username on platforms where you want people to find you.

## ✍️ Step 4: Write articles

It doesn't matter how often you write. Even writing once a year is good.

If you can't post often, you can have fewer, but longer & deeper articles. Alternatively you can write about what you're learning.

Even one in-depth article can show that you know your stuff. 

Don't feel blocked by not having your own blog. Post wherever it's easiest - it counts towards credibility either way as long as you link to it. 

If you write on Medium or dev.to, you can move posts to your own blog later, when you have one.

## 📝 Step 4.5: Submit articles to publications on Medium

Large publications take new contributors, especially from underrepresented groups.

Some examples of such publications: [Better Programming](https://betterprogramming.pub/write-for-us-5c4bcba59397), [The Startup](https://medium.com/swlh/start-it-up-submissions-3e8ed27bcd3e).

If your article ends up getting featured, you'll get extra credibility for free.

## 🕊 Step 5: Tweet about your trade

There's one simple rule: be helpful.

These formats provide good value:
- short summaries (of documentation, conference videos, technology launches)
- pro tips for tools popular in your industry
- did you know / nonobvious facts
- TIL (today I learned)
- unpopular opinion on the profession

Hot takes and rants don't add any credibility if you have none so far. Use them with caution.

Most of your tweets likely won't get traction, but some will.

And remember that number of followers != credibility, so don't worry about it and continue posting.

## 🐙 Step 6: Brush up your portfolios

If you're a developer (if you're reading this, most likely you are!), make your github account look nice.

Add descriptions on all your repositories. For sample code, the description can be 'sample code showcasing xxx'.

Pin repositories with most stars or most contributions from you.

If you're a designer, do the same with Dribble, Behance, etc.

## 🔎 Step 7: Google yourself

Search Google and DuckDuckGo by your username and by full name. If there are many people with the same name, add occupation or location to the search query. That's what people will do when they look you up.

Make sure the first 1–2 pages of results bring up professional links. You might have to hide or even delete accounts on old forums and other sites that you don't want to show up in search results.

## 🤩 Step 8: Host a hype page

You are your best advocate. The hype page might be a simple About page on your site. 
If you don't have a site, add these details to your LinkedIn profile.

You don't have to have a fancy design. Use emoji to lighten up and break up the text.

Link to previous projects and companies.

Whenever you give a public presentation, a talk, a workshop - mention it on your hype page. Link to the slides, the recording, the sample code. Even if the event was very local and wasn't recorded, slides are great for visibility and social proof. You can host slides on [speakerdeck.com](https://speakerdeck.com).

Link to any other appearances - if you gave an interview to a university newspaper, joined a podcast, etc.

<br> 

**And last, but not least** - give it time.

Credibility compounds over time. 
Start with a foundation, and add small bits as you go along. 
Soon enough you end up with a complex online presence that is authentic.

The steps mentioned in this article worked well for me and they will work for you 💪
